## How to contribute

If you are opening a Pull Request, follow the [rules of a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)
(no, your commit messages do not necessarily need to have a body).

You can contribute in the following ways:

### Testify!

Open a Pull Request or an Issue in which you: 
- Provide your testimony
- Provide the name you want to be quoted under

### Add a sermon

Open a Pull Request or an Issue in which you: 
- Provide the text of Lord DauT's quote
- Provide the source of your quote

### Add a mod to worship our Lord

Open a Pull Request or an Issue in which you: 
- Add a mod that worships the Lord to the worship page
- Must contain title, author, Link to mod center, explanatory text, optionally an additional image

### Suggest additional content

Open a Pull Request or an Issue in which you do just that.
Please do not be sad if your suggestion gets rejected :-(

### Make the page look prettier

I try my best, but I am no web designer, and it shows.

Open an pull request or an issue and work your magic to make this page look the best it can to please the Lord.
